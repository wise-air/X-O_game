Homework X-O game
This is my homework, and first real working project I made on Python.
Its Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play together with your friend.
There is not able to play with computer, because it wasn't in the task.

!!!I code there is little mistake. in check_errors function, there I'm checking in while cycle for error twice.
!!!В коде присутствует небольшая ошибка-опечатка. В функции check_errors в цикле while я дважды проверяю одно и то же.
